# CIV VI Modding Wiki

This is a simple documentation site for documenting how to Mod CIV VI.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

To run an instance of the Wiki locally to make changes checkout the project and run using

```console
yarn install && yarn start
```

Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Commit the changes and raise a PR into master, when approved the changes will be automatically deployed to github pages.
